Hi, I'm Amy Woodcock, and I'm an A-Level student in the UK who's interested in studying 
psychology at university next year. I've just completed a week of work 
experience with Open Science Tools at the University of Nottingham, who created
an free open source research software called PsychoPy, and its online equivalent 
Pavlovia, which I've been getting to know throughout the week.

I first heard about PsychoPy through a school teacher, who put me into contact 
with Professor Jon Peirce, and we arranged my work experience from there. I've 
spent this week familiarising myself with PsychoPy and Pavlovia surveys using 
tutorials. I also recreated a project based on a study I was interested in from my 
A-Level course (Steyvers and Hemmer, 2012) using PsychoPy. I found this 
challenging to put together, especially with debugging the code and trying to 
take participant responses and visualise the data at the end of my program. 
However, I completed the project, and even managed to add some extra features
using some Python code, like displaying an average as part of the results to the 
participant. The Open Science Tools team have been incredibly kind and helpful, 
and I am coming away having developed lots of skills that I think will really help 
me as I apply for psychology degrees. For example, I now have a knowledge of 
experimental design, experience with using technology like eye trackers and 
EEGs (electroencephalograms), and an understanding of how psychological 
research works (as well as a raging caffeine addiction).

In my experience as a complete beginner to using PsychoPy and designing 
experiments in general, I have found the software very intuitive and easy to 
learn how to use, and I've enjoyed brushing up on my (limited) Python skills to 
create a demo for the PsychoPy website. I have loved problem solving, and 
seeing my project come together to form a final finished project, with 
complicated stimuli and analysis of participant responses. I think that PsychoPy 
would be an incredibly useful tool to use in schools, as it is representative of how
psychology is taught and research is done at university level, and it is also easy 
enough to use at A-level. Additionally, I think Pavlovia surveys was useful in 
introducing me to more complex types of questions and surveys, and further 
concepts, such as basic JavaScript expressions.

Overall, I've found this week stretched me, but was incredibly useful and fun, 
and I would definitely recommend that other students in the same position as me
use online tools from PsychoPy to learn about what being a psychology student 
and researcher would be like.
