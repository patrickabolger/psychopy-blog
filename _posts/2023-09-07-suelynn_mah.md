## Background

During the first year of her undergraduate studies in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, Sue Lynn learned how to create PsychoPy tasks within the first few weeks of the semester and eventually started creating her tasks independently throughout her degree. When she started her PhD in Psychology at the University of Nottingham, she was the first in her cohort to launch a study to Pavlovia as the Covid pandemic had halted all in-person testing. Because of this, she was approached by students and staff in her school to help program and debug their task. Her tasks was also shared externally and one of it was used in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215001321000421" target="_blank">study</a> that was later published.


## Day in the Life

I would say a typically day as a Science Officer in Open Science Tools is never really felt the same. Most of the time, I would spend helping researchers creating PsychoPy tasks or contribute by writing documentation for a new feature. I would also help out in the forum by creating minimal demos based on the user's needs or creating slightly more advanced ones like this <a href="https://run.pavlovia.org/SueLynnNotts/leaderboard/" target="_blank">online leaderboard</a>. My favourite part of the PhD was designing experiments and making them into PsychoPy tasks so I would say that being able to do it as my job is definitely very enjoyable. I also have an interest in design and recently, I've learned how to create icons for PsychoPy features and am looking forward in helping to create them in the future.

PsychoPy was created in the University of Nottingham and because of that, we would be invited to talk about PsychoPy to prospective students. It's interesting because I was an undergraduate student in the Malaysian campus and also completed my PhD in University of Nottingham so I would be able to share my own experiences as a student and user of PsychoPy.
