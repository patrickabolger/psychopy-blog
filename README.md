This is built on
[Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

To compile locally you will need to install
- ruby
- gem bundler
- jekyll

**Note:** The theme uses the [jekyll-include-cache](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-include-cache) plugin which will need to be installed in your `Gemfile` and must be retained in the `plugins` array of `_config.yml`. Otherwise you'll encounter `Unknown tag 'include_cached'` errors at build.

## notable locations/types for files:

- posts should go in the `_posts` folder with `date_name.md` filename
- images should go in `assets/images`
- you can also see content of pages like indices/catalogues in `_pages`
- there are a range of automatic layouts in `_layouts`
- CSS tweaks can be added in `assets/css`
